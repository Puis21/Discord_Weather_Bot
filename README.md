A multi-purpose Discord bot that combines **real-time weather updates** with **fun social interaction**. Originally built as a lightweight weather bot, it’s now been upgraded with a **modular architecture**, **persistent database syncing**, and **clean error handling**, making it far more scalable and robust.

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 **Weather Command**  
  Fetches live weather data for any city using an API and gives a quick recommendation on whether it’s a good day to go outside.

- 🎯 **Target System**  
  Allows users to set a “target” in their server. When the target sends a message, the bot responds with randomized “friendly bullying” lines. Includes cooldowns to prevent spam and keep it light-hearted.

- 🧠 **PostgreSQL Integration** (🆕)  
  The bot now syncs with a PostgreSQL database using `asyncpg`, saving:
  - All joined servers (guilds)
  - Users and their usernames
  - User-server relationships
  - Command activity (in future versions)

- 🧩 **Modular Cog System** (🆕)  
  Code is now organized using `discord.py` cogs:
  - `weather.py`: API requests & weather logic
  - `target.py`: Target/bully logic
  - `database.py`: Database setup and future management commands

- 🤖 **Custom Bot Class & Setup Hook** (🆕)  
  Introduced a `CustomBot` subclass for better encapsulation. Initial extensions are auto-loaded, and commands are synced only to a test server or globally, depending on config.

- 🛡️ **Improved Error Handling** (🆕)  
  Gracefully handles:
  - Unknown commands
  - Missing arguments
  - Unexpected errors (with logs)

- 🔐 **Secure Environment Config**  
  Tokens and database credentials are stored using `.env` files for safety and easy deployment.

- 📜 **Rotating Log Files** (🆕)  
  Added structured logging with rotating file handlers to keep logs clean and manageable over time.
